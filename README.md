I was originally writing this Breakout-style game for the BlackBerry phone. What makes Java Breakout
unique is its built in Microsoft Paint-style level designer which allows you to create, save, load,
and play custom levels. Common tools such as the pencil, line creator, and color picker make designing
easy. You can even specify the size and spacing of the blocks as well as choose custom colors for the
blocks.

Still in beta after all these years so collisions are not perfect.

Use Left and Right to move the paddle. Press E to enter the editor.
